## 1.2
```
Added packaging split support - summaries can be now split based on packaging. Consider deals: 6x product1, 4x product1. Summary will display product1: 5x baggie, 1x jar

This option is configurable in the config file and is compatible with other options (time slot split).
```

## 1.1
```
Added time slot support - summaries can be now split based on time slots.
Added option to show UI on key press for a set amount of time - press a key to show UI, then shortly after it disappears.

Those options can be configured in the config file.

Fix: UI will no longer show until you have more than 1 deal (no point in summarizing 1 deal).
Fix: Fixed the UI not showing up when reloading the game after going to the main menu.
