## 1.1
```
Added time slot support - summaries can be now split based on time slots.
Added option to show UI on key press for a set amount of time - press a key to show UI, then shortly after it disappears.

Those options can be configured in the config file.

Fix: UI will no longer show until you have more than 1 deal (no point in summarizing 1 deal).
